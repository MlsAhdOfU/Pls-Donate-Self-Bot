Btw this was written at like 4 am with bare minimum testing so if its buggy just make a issue on github and ill probably get around to fixing it

Its pretty useful if you wanna afk and make some robux or something. Just look at the settings at the top of the

It has a autoboard type thing in so the board will auto update its "goal" (i.e. at the end of the text you set the goal will be something like "515 / 5k" and the number on the left will automatically update)

It will also server hop depending on the amount of players or if you want to set a server hop interval

## Script

```lua
-- You can change these

_G.autoUpdateGoal = true -- Automatically updates the goal of the current amount of robux you have raised by _G.increaseGoalBy amount (i.e. you have 525 robux raised and _G.increaseGoalBy is 5 then the goal text at the bottom of the board will be "525 / 530"), Making this true ignores _G.goal
_G.increaseGoalBy = 15 -- The Amount of which the autoUpdateGoal increase by 

_G.goal = "5k!" -- the goal it will auto set at the end of the text
_G.Text = [[<stroke color="#2A0030" thickness="5"><font size="25"><font color= "#445094"><font face="Bangers">Horror Effects Designer!</font></font></font></stroke>
Anything Helps!
Status: AFK
]] -- the text before the goal text (i.e "please help me out!\n Im a upcoming game dev!!!", replace the \n with a white space )

_G.saythanks = true -- Says thank you when they purchase something ("Thanks For Donating {Amount they donated}$!")
_G.thanksText = "Thanks for donating %s$!" -- %s is the amount of robux they donated, the text to thank the person
_G.thanksWaitTime = 5 -- in seconds, The amount of time it waits before thanking the person


_G.beg = true -- Begs in the chat every time the begInterval has past
_G.begInterval = 105 -- In Seconds
_G.begText = "If you donate i will roast someone!" -- text to beg with

_G.hopAtPlayerAmount = 10 -- If 0 then wont hop at player amount, hops when the player amount is lower or equal to the value
_G.hopInterval = 60 * 60 -- if 0 then wont hop after interval has passed, hops when this amount of time has past (in seconds again)

_G.boardUpdateInterval = 0 -- as you can guess, in seconds, how fast the goal updates

_G.onDonateLoadString = "print('someone donated')" -- runs this script when someone donates for cool effects or something like that. Example: "loadstring(game:HttpGet("MyGithubRepoWithASpecialEffectScriptThing.lua", true))()"

-- DONT Change! (or do if yk what you're doing)
_G.loadstr = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littlepriceonu/Pls-Donate-Self-Bot/main/source.lua"

loadstring(game:HttpGet(_G.loadstr, true))()
```
